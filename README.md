# GCTCV chromosomal deletion analysis ‚Äì Genomics and Transcriptomics Pipeline

This repository contains all analysis scripts and workflows used in the study:  
**Chromosomal deletions in banana somaclonal variants reveal negative regulators of immunity underlying Fusarium wilt resistance**  

It includes pipelines for RNA-seq, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and downstream data visualization to uncover **chromosomal deletions and their regulatory effects among the resistant lines of Giant Cavendish tissue-culture variants (GCTCVs)** selected by the **Taiwan Banana Research Institute (TBRI)**.
